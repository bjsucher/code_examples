## Brandon Sucher's Code Repository

#### I've included nine different folders of code that show a variety of projects I have worked on over the past few years. Below I explain what each of these folders contains. The gap in years is when I was a teaching assistant and then did various internships where I am unable to share the code on my personal Github page.

### GLM-Homework--October 2022
This homework is from my Generalized Linear Models class at Duke. My main purpose in including this code is it is my first experience with Quarto markdown.

### NBA-Best--April 2022
This project was from my Software Tools for Data Science class and I worked on it with two classmates. We pulled salary and game statistics data for NBA players to create a model that picks the optimal 5-man lineup based on user input. I created the parse files and built out most of the user interface. I also reviewed the model construction and testing files.

### EHR-Project--January-March 2022
This project was an individual cumulative project in my Software Tools for Data Science class. Throughout the class, I edited these files to conform to different data structures, so the files included are the final iteration of this project.

### Final-Project-702--October-December 2021
This project was an individual project for my Applied Biostatistical Methods I class. The code provided is basically the descriptive analysis and statistical tests that I had to conduct in order to complete this project. 

### R-Class-Duke--August-December 2021
These projects were the assignments completed in the Intro to Statistical Programming I (R) class at Duke. They cover a wide variety of R packages but focus mainly on creating production plots and tables. 

### Statsketball_Competition--March 2019
*This is Statistics* hosts an annual competition for high school and undergraduate students to create a model that predicts the outcome of the NCAA Tournament. They have two competitions: predicting first round winners and predicting the best teams of the tournament. Here is a link to learn more in depth of how the competition was conducted: https://thisisstatistics.org/home-2/statsketball/ I won the undergraduate competition for predicting the best teams of the tournament, winning for both the men's and women's NCAA tournament. I have a Jupyter Notebook that uses Python to create a ratings system that determines the best teams of the tournament.

### Python_Course--February-October 2019
I was asked to create a Python course for the BYU Statistics Department. I have attached the code for a few of the homework assignments as well as the final project that I wrote for the course.

### R Class Projects--February-March 2018 and April 2019
The box office sales and Detroit TV audience projects were done for a regression class at BYU. The home vs. away FT percentage project was done for a Bayesian statistics class at BYU. In this project, a classmate and I compared free throw percentages for home and away teams in college basketball for each stadium. 

### 3DMaze--March 2018
I created a 3D Maze using C++ for a Data Structures class at BYU.
