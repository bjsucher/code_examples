## Brandon Sucher's Code Repository

#### I've included four different folders of code that show a variety of projects I have worked on over the past few years. Below I explain what each of these folders contains.

### Statsketball_Competition--March 2019
*This is Statistics* hosts an annual competition for high school and undergraduate students to create a model that predicts the outcome of the NCAA Tournament. They have two competitions: predicting first round winners and predicting the best teams of the tournament. Here is a link to learn more in depth of how the competition was conducted: https://thisisstatistics.org/home-2/statsketball/ I won the undergraduate competition for predicting the best teams of the tournament, winning for both the men's and women's NCAA tournament. I have a Jupyter Notebook that uses Python to create a ratings system that determines the best teams of the tournament.

### Python_Course--February-October 2019
I was asked to create a Python course for the BYU Statistics Department. I have attached the code for a few of the homework assignments as well as the final project that I wrote for the course.

### R Class Projects--February-March 2018 and April 2019
The box office sales and Detroit TV audience projects were done for a regression class at BYU. The home vs. away FT percentage project was done for a Bayesian statistics class at BYU. In this project, a classmate and I compared free throw percentages for home and away teams in college basketball for each stadium. 

### 3DMaze--March 2018
I created a 3D Maze using C++ for a Data Structures class at BYU.
